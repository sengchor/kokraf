<h1>History</h1>

<p>
  The History system tracks all actions performed in the editor, allowing you to undo or redo changes.
  It helps you safely experiment with transformations, edits, and scene modifications without losing work.
</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    History controls are located in the <strong>Settings panel</strong> of the editor.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Undo & Redo</h2>
<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Undo</strong> reverts the last action. You can undo multiple steps, up to the limit of stored commands.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Redo</strong> reapplies the last undone action.
  </li>
  <li>
    The system supports a maximum of <strong>25 commands</strong> by default. Older commands are removed when this limit is exceeded.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported Actions</h2>
<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    History tracks operations such as object transformations (move, rotate, scale), geometry edits (vertex, edge, face modifications), mode switches, and other scene changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each action is recorded as a command object with an <strong>execute</strong> and <strong>undo</strong> function.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Clearing History</h2>
<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    You can clear all stored undo and redo steps using the <strong>Clear History</strong> option.
  </li>
  <li>
    This resets the history stack and removes all previously tracked commands.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Persistent History</h2>
<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    A <strong>Persistent</strong> checkbox is available in the History panel.
  </li>
  <li>
    When enabled, your undo/redo history will be saved even after closing or reloading the browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    If disabled, the history will reset when the editor is closed or reloaded.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Saving & Loading History</h2>
<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    History can be serialized into JSON, including all stored undo and redo commands.
  </li>
  <li>
    When loading from JSON, commands are revived using their respective classes. Unknown or unsupported commands are skipped with a warning.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="manual-note">
  Using the History system ensures that you can safely experiment with your scene, revert mistakes, and restore previous states of your work.
