<h1>Camera View</h1>

<p>
  The Camera View allows you to quickly switch between different cameras in your scene,
  including the default editor camera and any custom cameras you add.
</p>

<h2>Location</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    The camera dropdown is located at the <strong>top-right corner</strong> of the viewport.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    By default, the viewport uses the editor's main camera.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you add a new camera to the scene, it will automatically appear in the camera selection list.
  </li>
  <li>
    Selecting a camera from the dropdown will switch the viewport to that camera view.
  </li>
  <li>
    The default camera is labeled <strong>CAMERA</strong> in the dropdown, and other cameras are labeled by type (e.g., Perspective, Orthographic).
  </li>
  <li>
    Switching cameras does not change the scene; it only changes the viewport perspective.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    You can add multiple cameras to your scene for different views or cinematic setups.
  </li>
  <li>
    The camera dropdown updates automatically when cameras are added or removed from the scene.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="manual-note">
  Using multiple cameras is useful for previewing the scene from different angles, setting up cinematic shots, or testing lighting and composition.
