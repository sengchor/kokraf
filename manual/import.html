<h1>Import</h1>
<p>
  The <strong>Import</strong> feature is located in the <strong>File</strong> submenu of the menubar. 
  It allows you to bring external 3D objects into your current scene. Currently, the editor supports importing <strong>OBJ</strong> files.
</p>

<h2>How to Import</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Click the <strong>Import</strong> button in the File menu.</li>
  <li>Select a <strong>.obj</strong> file from your computer using the file picker dialog.</li>
  <li>The selected object will be loaded into your scene, maintaining its geometry and position.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The imported object will be added to the current scene without replacing existing objects.</li>
  <li>Only <strong>OBJ</strong> format is supported for now. Other formats may need conversion before import.</li>
  <li>Imported objects can be edited, transformed, and exported just like objects created inside the editor.</li>
</ul>
