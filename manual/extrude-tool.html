<h1>Extrude Tool</h1>

<p>
  The <strong>Extrude Tool</strong> allows you to create new geometry by extending
  selected <strong>vertices</strong>, <strong>edges</strong>, or <strong>faces</strong>
  in <strong>Edit Mode</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  You can control extrusion visually using the <strong>Transform Gizmo</strong>.
</p>

<p class="manual-note">
  Extrusion is essential for modeling complex shapes. New geometry is connected
  to the original selection.
</p>

<h2>How to Use Extrude</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    Select the vertices, edges, or faces you want to extrude.
  </li>
  <li>
    Activate the Extrude Tool.
    <span class="manual-input">E</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Move the mouse to extend the selection along the normal direction.
  </li>
  <li>
    Confirm with
    <span class="manual-input">Left Click</span>
    or
    <span class="manual-input">Enter</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cancel with
    <span class="manual-input">Esc</span>.
    The extruded geometry will remain, but new vertices will return to their original position.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Axis Constraints</h2>

<p>
  You can constrain extrusion to a specific axis for precise control.
</p>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    Press
    <span class="manual-input">X</span>,
    <span class="manual-input">Y</span>,
    or
    <span class="manual-input">Z</span>
    after activating Extrude to lock the extrusion to that axis.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Transform During Extrude</h2>

<p>
  After extruding, you can immediately move, rotate, or scale the new geometry
  without deactivating the tool.
</p>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    Move the mouse to position the extrusion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use <span class="manual-input">G</span>, <span class="manual-input">R</span>, or
    <span class="manual-input">S</span> to transform the extrusion in real-time.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Extrusion Direction</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    <strong>With at least one face selected:</strong>  
    The extrusion direction follows the <strong>average normal</strong> of the selected faces.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No faces selected:</strong>  
    The extrusion moves freely in any direction based on mouse movement.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="manual-note">
  Extrude works on all selection types (vertex, edge, face), but the resulting
  geometry depends on what is selected.
