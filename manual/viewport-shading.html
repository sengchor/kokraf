<h1>Viewport Shading</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Viewport Shading</strong> controls how objects in the scene are visually
  displayed in the 3D viewport. It allows you to preview your models in different
  shading styles for modeling, texturing, or debugging purposes.
</p>

<p class="manual-note">
  Viewport Shading does not affect the final render. It is only for visual feedback
  in the editor.
</p>

<h2>Location</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    The Viewport Shading menu is located at the <strong>top-right corner</strong> of
    the viewport.
  </li>
  <li>
    It can be changed by clicking the shading icon and selecting one of the available
    shading modes.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Shading Modes</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Material</strong> — displays objects with their assigned materials and textures. 
    <strong>Lighting in the scene is applied only in Material shading mode</strong>, allowing 
    realistic previews of colors, textures, and lights.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Solid</strong> — displays objects using a flat shaded material, helpful for
    modeling without textures. Uses a default gray color with MatCap lighting.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Normal</strong> — displays objects using vertex normals for a color-coded
    visualization of surface directions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wireframe</strong> — displays only the mesh edges, useful for analyzing
    geometry structure and topology.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavior</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    Changing the shading mode updates all objects in the main scene.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shading also affects how helper objects, lights, and cameras are displayed in
    the viewport.
  </li>
  <li>
    Switching to Solid or Normal mode automatically applies a preview material
    for easier visualization.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="manual-note">
  Use different shading modes to speed up your workflow: Solid for modeling, Material
  for texture preview, Normal for surface inspection, and Wireframe for topology analysis.
