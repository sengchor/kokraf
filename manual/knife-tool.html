<h1>Knife Tool</h1>

<p>
  The <strong>Knife Tool</strong> allows you to cut geometry manually by drawing a line
  across the mesh. It can create new vertices and edges by slicing through
  <strong>faces</strong>, <strong>edges</strong>, or snapping directly to
  <strong>existing vertices</strong>.
</p>

<p class="manual-note">
  The Knife Tool works in screen space and only affects visible geometry.
</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    Activate the Knife Tool.
    <span class="manual-input">K</span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Left Click</strong> to place the first cut point.
  </li>

  <li>
    Move the mouse to preview the cut line and intersections.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Left Click</strong> again to place the second cut point and apply the cut.
  </li>

  <li>
    Cancel the operation with
    <span class="manual-input">Esc</span>
    before confirming the second point.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Snapping</h2>

<p>
  The Knife Tool supports snapping to existing vertices for precise cuts.
</p>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    Snapping is only available in
    <strong>Vertex Select</strong> mode.
  </li>

  <li>
    Hover near a vertex to snap the cut point to it.
  </li>

  <li>
    Snapped vertices are reused and not duplicated.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Cut Behavior</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    The cut only affects visible faces facing the camera.
  </li>

  <li>
    Intersections are created where the cut line crosses edges.
  </li>

  <li>
    Faces intersected by the cut are automatically split into new faces.
  </li>

  <li>
    If the cut follows an existing edge or polyline, no new geometry is created.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Selection After Cut</h2>

<p>
  After applying a cut, the resulting selection depends on the current
  Edit Mode selection type.
</p>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    <strong>Vertex Select</strong> Mode — Newly created vertices are selected.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Edge Select</strong> Mode — Newly created edges are selected.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Face Select</strong> Mode — The selection is cleared.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="manual-note">
  The Knife Tool is ideal for adding controlled topology and refining mesh detail.
