<h1>Loop Cut Tool</h1>

<p>
  The <strong>Loop Cut Tool</strong> allows you to insert a new edge loop into
  a mesh while in <strong>Edit Mode</strong>.
</p>

<p class="manual-note">
  Loop cuts work on continuous quad-based geometry. The new edges are inserted
  at the midpoint of existing edges.
</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    Activate the Loop Cut Tool.
    <span class="manual-input">Ctrl</span> +
    <span class="manual-input">R</span>
    or click the Loop Cut tool in the viewport toolbar.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hover over the mesh to preview the edge loop.
    A <strong>yellow highlight</strong> indicates where the cut will occur.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click
    <span class="manual-input">Left Click</span>
    to apply the loop cut.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Loop Cut Behavior</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    Loop cuts follow connected quad faces to form a continuous edge loop.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the loop forms a closed ring, the cut will wrap fully around the mesh.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the loop is open, the cut will stop at the mesh boundary or when it encounters a non-quad face.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Selection After Loop Cut</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    After applying a loop cut, the newly created geometry is automatically selected.
  </li>
  <li>
    In <strong>Vertex Select</strong> Mode, the new vertices created by the loop cut are selected.
  </li>
  <li>
    In <strong>Edge Select</strong> Mode, the new edge loop is selected.
  </li>
  <li>
    In <strong>Face Select</strong> Mode, no faces are selected.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="manual-note">
  This allows you to immediately move, scale, or slide the new loop without
  reselecting it.
