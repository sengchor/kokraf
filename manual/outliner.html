<h1>Outliner</h1>
<p>
  The Outliner is located in the <strong>sidebar</strong> and displays a hierarchical list of all objects in your scene. 
  It provides a visual representation of your scene graph and allows you to select, organize, and reorder objects efficiently.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Object Selection:</strong> Click on any object in the Outliner to select it. The selected object is highlighted both in the Outliner and in the viewport.</li>
  <li><strong>Hierarchy View:</strong> Child objects are displayed nested under their parent objects, reflecting the structure of your scene.</li>
  <li><strong>Drag & Drop Reordering:</strong> You can drag objects to reorder or reparent them:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drag Above/Below:</strong> Move the object before or after another object at the same hierarchy level.</li>
      <li><strong>Drag Into:</strong> Make the object a child of another object.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Automatic Updates:</strong> The Outliner automatically refreshes when objects are added, removed, renamed, or moved in the scene hierarchy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Objects cannot be made children of themselves or any of their descendants.</li>
  <li>Dragging multiple selected objects is disabled to prevent hierarchy conflicts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Integration with Selection</h2>
<p>
  Selecting an object in the Outliner automatically updates the selection in the viewport and the toolbar. 
  This keeps all selection-based tools synchronized, so you can interact with your objects consistently across the interface.
