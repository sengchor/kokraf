<h1>X-Ray Mode</h1>

<p>
  <strong>X-Ray Mode</strong> allows you to see through objects in the scene, 
  making it easier to select or edit geometry that is hidden behind other objects.
</p>

<h2>Location</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    The X-Ray toggle is located at the <strong>top-right corner</strong> of the viewport,
    next to the viewport shading controls.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the <strong>X-Ray</strong> icon to enable or disable the mode.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Functionality</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    When X-Ray is enabled, all objects in the scene become partially transparent.
  </li>
  <li>
    This allows you to select vertices, edges, and faces that are normally hidden behind other geometry.
  </li>
  <li>
    X-Ray works in combination with the selection tools, including click and box selection.
  </li>
  <li>
    It can be used together with snapping and transform tools for precise editing of hidden components.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Shading Compatibility</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    X-Ray mode works only with <strong>Solid</strong> and <strong>Normal</strong> shading.
  </li>
  <li>
    It will <strong>not work</strong> with <strong>Material</strong> or <strong>Wireframe</strong> shading.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you switch to a shading mode where X-Ray does not work, it will automatically disable.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you switch back to a compatible shading mode (Solid or Normal), X-Ray will automatically re-enable.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
  X-Ray does not affect the final render; it is only for viewport editing and selection.
</p>

<p class="manual-note">
  Enabling X-Ray is especially helpful in Edit Mode when working on internal components of a mesh.
