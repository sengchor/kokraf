<h1>Interaction Modes</h1>

<p>
  Interaction Modes define how you interact with objects in the viewport. The two main modes are 
  <strong>Object Mode</strong> and <strong>Edit Mode</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Location</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    The Interaction Modes dropdown is located at the <strong>top-left corner</strong> of the viewport.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Object Mode</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    Object Mode allows you to select, move, rotate, and scale whole objects.
  </li>
  <li>
    All objects in the scene are selectable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some tools and features are only available in Object Mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>selection box</strong> can be used to select multiple objects in Object Mode.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Edit Mode</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    Edit Mode allows you to modify the geometry of a mesh, including vertices, edges, and faces.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must select exactly one mesh object before entering Edit Mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    Edit Mode enables sub-selection modes: <strong>Vertex</strong>, <strong>Edge</strong>, and <strong>Face</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some tools are only available in Edit Mode, such as vertex snapping, extrusion, or direct geometry manipulation.
  </li>
  <li>
    You cannot select other objects while in Edit Mode; only the geometry of the selected mesh can be modified.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul class="nav-list">
  <li>
    Some features are available in both Object and Edit Mode, such as transform controls (move, rotate, scale) and snapping.
  </li>
  <li>
    Switching between modes automatically updates the available tools and viewport helpers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Attempting to enter Edit Mode without a mesh selected will display a warning.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="manual-note">
  Using the correct interaction mode is important for efficient workflow. Object Mode is for scene-level manipulation, while Edit Mode is for detailed geometry editing.
